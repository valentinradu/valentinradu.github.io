Valentin is a highly passionate iOS Entrepreneur with 9+ years experience in software development. Over the years, he worked on multiple projects, using various paradigms, technologies, frameworks and programming languages, but generally leveraging around the ECMAScript dialects, the C family languages and the OOP paradigm.

For the past 6+ years he planned, developed, published and maintained various iOS apps. Beyond iOS though, Valentin is able to influence multiple areas of development. He has a good project overview, from system use cases, through user experience and graphic design (ready to go the extra mile for a pixel perfect interface) to client and server side development, source control and publishing.

Audio and image processing is Valentinâ€™s strongest point followed up closely by micro architecture and design. He also has a good understanding of the MIDI standard, the HTTP protocol, REST, cross-compilation, compilers front ends (especially with gcc and clang), web servers (mongoose), source control and Objective-C runtime.

Valentin is a strong advocate of the SOLID and GRASP principles.
Always seeks to automate any tedious task.
Refactors often.
Relies heavily on the IDE and Regex to refactor code, trying to minimise the effort of manual refactoring.
Adopts new technologies early.
Tries to brake his code in every single test-case he can think of, before sending it to the testing department.
