Not a ninja, nor a superhero or a superstar, but a honest craftsman taking pride in his work, always willing to learn new things.

Over the years, Valentin worked on multiple projects, using various paradigms, technologies, frameworks and programming languages, but generally leveraging around the C family languages and the OOP paradigm.

He's a strong advocate of the SOLID and GRASP principles.
Always seeks to automate any tedious task.
Refactors often.
Relies heavily on the IDE and Regex to refactor code, trying to minimize the manual refactoring effort.
Adopts new technologies early.
Tries to brake his code in every single possible way he can think of, before sending it to the testing department.
Doesn't have a cat.
